# 1. Ignore all folders named processor* (e.g., processor0, processor123)
processor*/

# 2. Ignore all files with 'log' in the name and no extension
# We assume "no extension" means no dot after the log in filename
# This pattern matches any file containing "log" but no dot after
# The safest is to ignore files containing log but not ending with an extension:
# We'll do a bit of approximation with two patterns:

# Ignore files containing 'log' without a dot after
# Match files like "errorlog" but NOT "error.log" or "errorlog.txt"
# So exclude files with dot anywhere after 'log' by only matching those without a dot
# Gitignore doesn't support negative lookaheads, so approximate:

# Ignore files named *log (with no extension)
*log
# Ignore files with 'log' anywhere but no extension
# To avoid ignoring things like *.log or log.txt, this is tricky.
# So you may want to ignore files named exactly *log or containing 'log' but no dot

# As a compromise:
# Ignore files containing 'log' but not having dot after 'log'
# So, ignore files with 'log' and no dot anywhere in filename:
*[!.\]*log*[!.\]*

# This is tricky, and gitignore syntax is limited — test carefully!

# 3. Ignore all time folders everywhere, except inside simulation_results

# First ignore all folders named only with digits (time folders)
# ^ matches start, $ end; but gitignore doesn't support regex anchors, so:
# Match directories named only digits anywhere:
!0/
[1-9]*/
[0-9]*.[0-9]*/
[0-9]*.[0-9][0-9]*/

# But that also matches folders inside simulation_results, which we want to keep

# So add an exception for simulation_results and its subfolders:

# Don't ignore any folder named digits inside simulation_results:
!**/simulation_results/
!**/simulation_results/**
!**/simulation_results/**/[0-9]*/
!**/simulation_results/**/[0-9]*.[0-9][0-9]*/
